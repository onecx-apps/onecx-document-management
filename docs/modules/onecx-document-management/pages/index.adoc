== Overview
OneCX Document Management Software is a comprehensive solution for managing documents in a user-friendly and efficient manner.
It is a solution that consists of three main components: a backend service, a user interface, and a backend-for-frontend (BFF) layer.

The three components of OneCX Document Management Software are as follows:

. Document Management UI
  The user interface component is based on Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications.
  It offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface for interacting with the document management system.
  Users can perform actions such as uploading documents, searching, linking them with others or attaching files to it, etc..

. Document Management BFF
  The BFF layer acts as an intermediary between the frontend user interface and the backend service.
  It handles tasks such as data aggregation, transformation, and composition to provide an optimized API for the UI.
  The BFF layer is designed to enhance performance and simplify the integration of the frontend with the backend service.

. Document Management Backend
  This component provides the core functionality for document management.
  It handles tasks such as document storage, retrieval, metadata management, and access control.
  The backend is built cloud native using Quarkus.

Interfaces are based on the TM-Forum standard link:https://github.com/tmforum-apis/TMF667_Document[TMF 667].
